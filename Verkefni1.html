	<h1>"Yesterday"</h1>
	<p>
		Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away.<br>
		Now it looks as though they're here to stay.<br>
		Oh, I believe in yesterday.
	</p>
	<p>
		Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be.<br>
		There's a shadow hanging over me.<br>
		Oh, yesterday came suddenly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Why she had to go?<br>
		I don't know, she wouldn't say.<br>
		I said something wrong.<br>
		Now I long for yesterday.
